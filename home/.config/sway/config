# Hold on to your broomsticks. Customizing the way that Firefox starts up across
# multiple workspaces is black magic.
#
# Background: Firefox is installed by home-manager, which allows us to configure
# "profiles," each of which contains settings and state like the previous
# session. We have a default "browsing" profile and a separate "discord" profile
# for reasons explained below.
#
# Goal: Have Discord open in its own window in workspace 1, while the rest of
# our windows/tabs open in workspace 2.
#
# When Firefox restores a previous session, those windows open out of sync with
# the swaymsg commands that switch between workspaces. Since we want to place
# some windows in different workspaces, we need to isolate instances of Firefox
# so sway's "startup-id" mechanism can function properly.
#
# By executing a new instance with a dedicated profile for Discord, we guarantee
# that only one window is spawned in workspace 1. Since we may spawn multiple
# windows from the "browsing" profile in workspace 2, we do this last so as long
# as the user doesn't quickly switch workspaces while the windows are spawning,
# they will all go to workspace 2.
